Daily Sprints 9/19:
	met to go over code
	set up github repo
	located several opportunities for refactoring in the BrahmaApp project:
		Brahma.java:
			looks fine
		Plugin.java:
			looks fine
		PluginCore.java:
			Does too much
				Does view and controller logic, intermixed
				Constructor is huge, first step is to simplify constructor, second step is to separate view and controller logic as much as possible.
		PluginManager.java:
			Coupling with PluginCore and WatchDir is bad. Should use interfaces to decouple.
		Watchdir.java:
			Process events method is big
			Is an infinite loop the best way to handle process events?
			why does this have a main method?
